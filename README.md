"Advanced" calculator which uses formulas to calculate let's say hypotenuse or discriminant
I want to make it huge, by that I mean that I'll put every possible and existing math formula in this piece of art. 

List of formulas: 

  1) Hypotenuse
  2) Discriminant
  3) Area of a circle
  4) Quadratic
  5) 2D Distance
  6) 3D Distance
  7) Midpoint
  8) Sine
  9) Cosine
  10) Tangent
  11) Slope
  12) Circumference of circle
